Day - 1
Write a program to accept a number and determine whether it is a prime number or not.

Day-2:
Write a method which accepts an array of integers as a parameter and returns the second highest element in the given array. If there are multiple such element, it can be printed just once.
Write a method which accepts an array of consecutive integers with just one integer missing as a parameter and returns that missing integer. Consider the following conditions:
The entered integers are in an ascending order.
The entered integers are in a descending order.
The entered integers are not in any particular order.
Example: Input array is [2,3,4,5,6,8,9] Returned value: 7
Learn and implement the following sorting techniques: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort.
Write a method that accepts two parameters: an integer and an array of integers. Search for the entered integer value in the array of integers, and return “True” if present, “False” if not present. Use the following search techniques: Linear Search, Binary Search.
Write a method that accepts an integer as a parameter and returns the identity matrix of the order as that of the entered integer. 
Note: An identity matrix has equal number of rows and columns, its diagonal elements have a value 1 and all other elements have a value 0.
